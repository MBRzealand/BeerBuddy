# Zealand BeerBuddy

Our school needed a way to keep track of alcohol sale for our intro party, and planned to do it by hand, instead I spent a few days on quickly throwing together an app to do it.  
  
Ideally I'd have put the storage UI in a different activity to keep it cleaner, as well as hook up a database for persistance, however I was pressed for time, and didn't have time to properly implement it.  
  
The code in this application is absolutely horrible and I recommend not looking at it too thoroughly if you want to be able to sleep at night, it was created on a very short deadline.
